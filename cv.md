Hi:raised_hand:,\
I am a UI&UX designer with 6 years of experience in Web & Mobile design.
Experienced in user research, crafting fully interactive prototypes, usability testing and building complex and UX heavy products from ground up.
Recently I realised that adding Front-end development skills to my skillset would be amazing. That's why I am here.

## Latest code examples
Unfortunately so far I don't have decent code examples, so will go with simple html copy pasted from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_emojis.asp. Hope it won't be a problem.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
