Hi:raised_hand:,\
I am a UI&UX designer with 6 years of experience in Web & Mobile design.
Experienced in user research, crafting fully interactive prototypes, usability testing and building complex and UX heavy products from ground up.
Recently I realised that adding Front-end development skills to my skillset would be amazing. That's why I am here.

Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
